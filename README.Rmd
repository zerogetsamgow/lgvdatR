# lgvdatR

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of {lgvdatR} is to create easily accessible datasets related to Local Governments in Victoria.

{lgvdatR} compiles data from the 

[Essential Service Commission's Local Council Outcomes Report](https://www.esc.vic.gov.au/local-government/rate-capping-outcomes-reports/local-council-outcomes-report-2023)

[Victorian Audit-General's Office's Results of Local Government Audits Report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/results-2022-23-audits-local-government)

[Australian Bureau of Statistic's Regional Population](    https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/population/regional-population/latest-release)

Data from these sources is saved in `r length(list.files("./data"))` datasets, `r unlist(list.files("./data"))`

{lgvdatR} includes one function `clean_lga()` that provides for cleaning of local government names. It borrows heavily from `strayr::clean_state()`
